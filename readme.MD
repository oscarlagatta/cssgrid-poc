# CSS Grid Proof of Concept

In this proof of concept, we explore the power and flexibility of CSS Grid for creating responsive and dynamic layouts.

## Introduction

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows you to create two-dimensional grid-based layouts in CSS. It provides a
more intuitive way to design complex web layouts compared to traditional methods like using floats or positioning.

## Example Layout

To demonstrate the capabilities of CSS Grid, we will create a simple example layout. Our layout will consist of a
header, a sidebar, a main content area, and a footer.

### Desktop View

In the desktop view, the layout will have a 3-column grid, with the header spanning the full width and the sidebar and
main content area placed next to each other.

### Mobile View

In the mobile view, the layout will change to a single-column grid, with each section stacked vertically.

## CSS Grid Code

Let's take a look at the CSS code that creates this layout using CSS Grid.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
}

.header {
  grid-area: header;
}

.sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}

.main {
  grid-area: main;
}

.footer {
  grid-area: footer;
}
